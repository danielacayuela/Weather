# Weather

This site is under construction. I am working on making it responsive.

The Wetaher app was built with JavaScrit and React. Sweetalert library was also included.

It is a simple app, where you can search for different cities around the world and check weather information such as maximum and minimum temperature.

As you search for cities, they are included in Home. If you try to enter a city that has already been searched, an alarm will warn you that it is not possible to include it. Likewise, it will notify if the city does not exist.

When entering the details of the city, you can see more information about it, including winds, latitude, longitude and temperature, among others.

A brief description of the application can be found in About.

To run the project you must install it (npm install or npm i) and run it with npm start.
